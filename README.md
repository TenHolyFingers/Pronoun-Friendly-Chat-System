# Pronoun-Friendly-Chat-System
This Pronoun-Friendly Chat System was developed as part of my Advanced Java coursework to create a more inclusive and respectful online communication space. The system allows users to set and be addressed by their preferred pronouns, ensuring gender-affirming interactions.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
âœ… Custom Pronoun Support â€“ Users can define their pronouns for a personalized chat experience.
âœ… Real-Time Text Filtering â€“ Uses Java String Handling techniques to detect and replace inappropriate/misgendering terms.
âœ… User-Friendly GUI â€“ A clean, intuitive interface built for accessibility.
âœ… Database Integration â€“ Securely stores user settings and chat logs.

This project strengthened my skills in Java GUI development, database connectivity, and text processing, while aligning with my goal of building ethical and inclusive tech solutions.
